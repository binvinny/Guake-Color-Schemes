## Guake Color Schemes

### Introduction

__An easy way to configure the  color schemes of guake__.

Note that, all themes  are cited from the awesome repository [Gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh), and you can preview all  themes [here](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh/blob/master/content/themes.md). Unfortunately, it seems not to provide an interface for guake. Inspired by [guake-color-palettes](https://github.com/coolwanglu/guake-colors-solarized) and [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes), this repository provides an easy way to configure  the color schemes of guake.
